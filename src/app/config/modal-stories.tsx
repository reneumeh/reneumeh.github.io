    'PART DESIGN': <p>Part design is where engineering dreams hit the road—literally, in my case! Back in my college days, I was knee-deep in designing car parts with the <a href="https://www.racehanyang.com" target="_blank">RACE</a> club. Imagine a group of sleep-deprived students huddled over CATIA and ANSYS, debating whether a bumper should look cool or actually protect. While my experience is rooted in hands-on, real-life car components, my knowledge about mass production is still largely textbook-based. Designing for the masses is a whole different ball game, where it&apos;s not just about looking good or fitting perfectly, but also about scalability and cost-efficiency. So, if you see me eyeing assembly lines with a mix of awe and trepidation, you&apos;ll know why!</p>,
    'ANALYSIS' : "Part analysis is where the real magic happens—or where things can go spectacularly wrong if you’re not careful! Having delved into fluid and thermal analyses, I've learned that parts don’t just sit around looking pretty; they’re constantly interacting with their environment. Vibrational and control system analyses have shown me that even the tiniest shake can make a big difference. And let’s not forget failure analysis, which is a bit like being a detective, except the clues are usually broken bits and frustrated sighs. Analyzing a part is often a marathon, not a sprint—far trickier and time-consuming than the initial design.",
    'AUTOMOBILE' : <p>My journey with automobiles began with a summer stint at a mechanic workshop—I wish I still had photos of me in those bright orange overalls. I gained hands-on experience, though I must admit, the inner workings of these mechanical marvels were still a bit of a mystery. Enter college and the <a href="https://www.racehanyang.com" target="_blank">RACE</a> club: a playground for aspiring car aficionados. I started on the dynamics team, where I learned the ropes of how cars handle and perform, and then transitioned to the suspension team, diving deep into how those shock-absorbing miracles keep everything smooth. It was in RACE that I finally pieced together the whole picture of how cars work, turning my initial fascination into a full-blown passion.</p>,
    'CODING' : "My coding journey started with a bet from my dad when I was 12: write a program or lose a shot at $10. I took him up on it, though I didn’t dive deeply into programming until college. I began with Python, which was a great introduction, and then broadened my skills to include MATLAB, JavaScript, and C++. I’ve learned that once you’re comfortable with one language, picking up others is much easier. It’s like getting the hang of a few different dialects of the same language—each has its own flavor, but the core principles remain the same.",
    'AI & DL/ML' : <p>I first was introduced to Machine Learning in an AI class in my 2nd year. The class was directed by Prof Kim douglas Deok Su and it covered everything from AI history to actual programming, culminating in creating my own CNN. I then continued my career in AI with an internship at the <a href="https://www.kist.re.kr/eng/research/artificial-intelligence-introduction.do" target="_blank">Korean Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)'s Center for Artificial Intelligence research</a> at the Professor Lim&apos;s AI lab. We had meetings twice every week where we would research and present on academic papers, and Professor Lim would talk about all the new developments in the AI world from DreamFusion to Plenoxels. I even attended my first academic conference, <a href='https://kcvs.kr/?act=info.workshop&pseq=4' target='_blank'>Korea&apos;s Conference on Computer Vision (KCCV)</a>, then. Nowadays I try to enter some ML challenges on Kaggle.</p>,
    '3D MODELING' :  <p>I&apos;m always working with 3D modeling tools as an engineer, but that's their finished state. My introduction to 3D rendering came during an internship at the <a href="https://www.kist.re.kr/eng/research/artificial-intelligence-introduction.do" target="_blank">Korean Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)'s Center for Artificial Intelligence research</a>, where I got to work on rendering and post-processing scenes for training an AI model. It was like stepping behind the curtain to see how 3D magic happens. Later, I worked with Professor Kim Douglas Deok Su, creating 3D models of satellites on a globe for Spacemap. It&apos;s pretty cool to see how 3D modeling can turn abstract data into something so visual and engaging.</p>,
    'UI/UX DESIGN' : " I am a Mechanical Engineer so this is not really what I was trained to do. However, I always appreciate good design so I wanted to understand how it is done. I am self taught and I like to learn all the time. I designed this webpage, as a first project, and if you think that it is not much for someone who claims they are decent at web design, first of all, ouch. Second of all, like I said, it was my first project. Third of all, this was not my initial idea for the page. It was supposed to be video game or news themed but after some A/B testing, some people felt that I should make it more professional.",
    'WEB DEV' : <p>I started web development at <a href="https://spacemap42.com" target="_blank">SpaceMap</a>. I found myself drawn to the front end team at the company, and I started working on projects, after I completed a course on web development. I wouldn&apos;t say that I am a hobbyist, because I have worked on a professional team, but so far I haven&apos;t actively built a career around web development. I DID build this website though. Now you might web dev and web design are the the same thing, so why did I split them up? Well, kind of, I split them up here so that it would look better in the design. But, they are not the same. I had to learn react for months, just so I could say that.</p>,
    'STUDENT COUNCIL' : <p>In 2022, I had the privilege of serving as President of the Student Body of the <a href='https://www.sdream.or.kr/' target='_blank'>Samsung Dream Scholarship Foundation</a>. In this role, I was responsible for organizing events and facilitating communication between students and the foundation. This experience allowed me to develop and demonstrate my leadership skills, effectively managing responsibilities and fostering a collaborative environment. By acting as a bridge between diverse groups, I honed my ability to address complex issues and drive initiatives forward, showcasing my capacity for leadership and organizational management in a professional setting.</p>,
    'SOCIAL MEDIA' : <p>During my tenure as President of the <a href='https://www.instagram.com/samsung_foundation/' target='_blank'>Student Body</a> for the Samsung Dream Scholarship Foundation, I managed the social media outreach, honing my skills in digital communication and engagement. This experience was instrumental in shaping my approach to social media strategy. Building on this foundation, I later took on a similar role at <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/spacemap42" target="_blank">Spacemap</a>, where I was responsible for overseeing the company&apos;s social media accounts. My work contributed significantly to enhancing the company&apos;s online presence and outreach.—it's about driving engagement and building a strong, cohesive brand image.</p>,
    'DEBATE': <p>Growing up, my siblings and I would give morning presentations on everything from the meaning of a song to a book we&apos;d read, so I was pretty comfortable with public speaking. I started debating in high school, after some encouragement from my brother. Fast forward to my first year at university, and I jumped into the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hyds_official/" target="_blank">Hanyang Debate Society (HYDS)</a>. I even made it to the quarterfinals at the KIDA rookie tournament.I didn&apos;t stick around forever though; soon after, I got caught up in the <a href="https://www.racehanyang.com" target="_blank">RACE</a> club. Still, debating taught me a lot about thinking on my feet and making a solid argument, which I&apos;ve definitely carried with me.</p>,
    'VOLUNTEER' : <p>Volunteering has always felt like the best way to truly connect with the community around you. During my exchange semester at UT Austin, I volunteered at the <a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/austin-animal-center" target="_blank">Austin Animal Center</a>, where I got to hang out with some adorable, tail-wagging friends and contribute to their care. Back in Seoul, I also volunteered at the Seoul Elderly Welfare Center, which was a humbling experience filled with meaningful interactions. As student council president, I organized an English teaching program to support underpreviledged Korean elementary students. These opportunities not only allowed me to give back but also deepened my understanding of the local communities</p>,
