    <p> Writing a patent is kind of like baking the perfect sourdough loaf. It’s long, unique, and requires a lot of iterations to get just right. Now, I have never baked a sourdough loaf before, nor have I created an actual official patent, so take my advice with a pinch of salt (I am so good at connecting these metaphors). However, I did work on a project that ended in a mock patent, and this is a "what I learned along the way" article. My experience came from redesigning a dumpling screw at CJ Foods, which involved a lot of dough, some engineering, and a lot of revisions. But more on that later. Let’s start with the basics and figure out how to craft your own “perfect sourdough” of a patent.</p>, 
    <h2>Start with a Clear Problem</h2>,
    <p>Ofourse, you have to start somewhere, get banchmarks, and set goals.This is usually standard for any project, but it it especially important here. In my case, we couldn't really set concrete bechmarks or goals. There was a lot of paperwall before we got access to the existing design. However, we did have ideas of kind of goals we would want to acieve and that was reducing dough retention in the screw, which could lead to better efficiency and reduce contamination. And we also wanted to redesign the screw to knead and convey dough more efficiently. In engineering terms, we wanted to increase the areas of high shear, and shear rate.</p>,
    <p>
    To get started, you want to ask yourself: What exactly are you trying to solve? The clearer you define the problem, the easier it is to develop a solution. In the context of a patent, this "problem statement" becomes your North Star, guiding your design and ensuring that everything you create has a purpose.</p>,
    <h2>Research Existing Solutions</h2>,
    <p>Just in general, if you are trying to solve a problem, someone has probably already written a book/paper about it. Youwould not believe that people have whole books just dedicated to screw conveyors, so the main objective is to find the right material. If you are still in school, check if your school allows access to academic journals. Also, try to get your hands on some books dediated to the subject. It helps you really understand what to consider and usually has most of the factors/equations that you need to consider in one place</p>,
    <h2>Design and Iteration</h2>,
    <p>
      For the dumpling screw, I had to balance high shear rates (to knead the dough properly) with minimizing wear and tear on the screw itself. This meant I spent a lot of time tweaking the flight angle and geometry to optimize dough flow.</p>,
      <p>
        At this stage, your ideas don’t have to be perfect. Sketch out rough concepts, test them mentally (or through simulation software like I did with ANSYS Fluent), and refine them as you go. The goal is to iterate your design until it addresses the problem in the best possible way.

        <h2>Simulations and/or Prototyping</h2>,
        <p>
          This is where you break out the big guns.`</p>,
